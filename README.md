# citi-bike-data

For this challenge I used 500 rows of data from the November citi bike data and 500 rows from the December citi bike data. I created a story in Tableau to make comparisons between November and December. The story was published to Tableau public. Here is a link to my public file: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashley.cooper1991/viz/citibikedata_17408808604810/Story1?publish=yes
